<h1 id="context">Context</h1>

<p>I recently finished an undergrad degree at a college I <em>hated</em> (horribly
bureaucratic, untrained professors, donkey-work for projects/assignments).</p>

<p>I feel like I have a 4 year debt to make up for - skills I should have learned
in my undergrad, but never had the time to. In the coming year or so, I&rsquo;m hoping
to fix that by experimenting much more, and hopefully picking up skills that I
think are important to me. For lack of a better name for what I plan to spend my
free time on in the coming year or so, I&rsquo;ll call it&hellip;</p>

<h1 id="the-experiment">The Experiment</h1>

<p>Tentatively, I&rsquo;m considering 2 weeks of low-key, research time, followed by 2
months of intensive study and practice in the given field. Since I don&rsquo;t plan to
uproot my life and follow a rigid schedule (I&rsquo;ll continue to have a personal
life, work part-time, work on open-source, etc.) I think managing 1 or 2
subjects at a time is likely the most I can handle.</p>

<h2 id="candidate-skills">Candidate skills</h2>

<ul>
<li>Writing (starting with this very post :))</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Illustration</li>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Game theory (I took one course when I was 14 thinking it was about the theory
of games, and I went halfway through it - it blew my mind)</li>
<li>Physics (light, energy, astronomy, quantum mechanics) - likely split it into
its own respective fields when I get around to it</li>
<li>Math (topology, category theory, chaos theory)</li>
<li>Programming language theory</li>
<li>Compiler theory (optimizations, transformations, safety)</li>
<li>Embedded systems and electronics</li>
<li>Cryptography?</li>
<li>Distributed systems and server-management</li>
<li>Quantum computing</li>
<li>Neuroscience, neurobiology, neuroengineering
(<a href="https://i.imgur.com/ibsNHc6.png">braaiiiiinsssss!</a>)</li>
<li>Art (generative art, painting, sculpting)</li>
<li>History (what&rsquo;s humanity accomplished so far?)</li>
<li>Music</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an entirely non-committal list, of course. My broad aim in studying
these fields is to maximize my skillset in areas that I think will have the
largest impact on our future. The overarching goals I have as my motivation for
these skills are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Programming language theory - imagine how much faster our rate of innovation
could be if we had languages that made formal verification easier? (NASA
spends months reviewing code, statically analyzing it - languages like Rust
may eliminate a whole class of errors that need to be checked for, right?)</li>
<li>Quantum computing - because it&rsquo;s <em>quantum freaking computing!</em> I imagine
this will be the radical shift that makes the impractical science fiction
possible.</li>
<li>Neuroengineering - if we could help more people &ldquo;be better&rdquo; (mood disorders,
memory problems, paralysis), through whatever means (programming the brain,
cyborg prosthetics, technology-aids), we could help unleash the potential of
<em>so many</em> more people.</li>
<li>Communication - our ideas are worthless if we can&rsquo;t actually communicate them
and have others help make them reality. Some skills like sales, marketing,
illustration, I don&rsquo;t really care for myself, but I do believe a basic
knowledge in these areas is necessary if I&rsquo;m to succeed in my larger
goals. I&rsquo;m okay to pick up enough to understand when I&rsquo;ve found a brilliant
salesperson or illustrator. Besides, I believe anything can be interesting if
you dive deep enough and actually scratch the surface. There&rsquo;s always
complexity that can be fascinating.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>How I go about acquiring these skills will likely vary from field to field - it
would be nice if I could find people to exchange skills with (i.e. I teach you
something I know, such as programming, systems programming, introductory German,
basic Math, Physics, etc. and you teach me one of the skills above (or really
anything, honestly, I love learning)).</p>

<hr />

<p>Life <em>is</em> going to get in the way, inevitably, so I&rsquo;m being noncommittal about
both which topics I pick and when their &ldquo;deadlines&rdquo; will be - but I need to keep
in mind that there <em>will</em> be deadlines. I&rsquo;ve focused on my little bubble of tech
for some 8 years - I ought to broaden my horizons, so to speak.</p>

<h1 id="let-the-games-begin">Let the games begin</h1>

<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>

<p>For starters, this blog will be my test-bed to improve my writing. I don&rsquo;t intend
to study writing intensively, except perhaps reading more blogs, &ldquo;finding my
voice&rdquo;, and perhaps reading Stephen King&rsquo;s On Writing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll try to blog more about knickknacks I find fascinating and end up
researching here and there too.</p>

<h3 id="rust">Rust</h3>

<p>As a build-up towards programming language theory, I&rsquo;m likely going to have to
study more languages that aim for lofty goals such as memory-safety, data-race
protection, and increased usability <em>without</em> sacrificing performance.</p>

<p>Also, I need to learn me some Rust for my day-job, a convenient coincidence.</p>

<p>I think the activities that&rsquo;ll help me learn it are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reading a lot of varied Rust code (Github
(<a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno">Deno</a> looks interesting), <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust">CodeReview on
StackExchange</a>,
answering questions on StackOverflow)</li>
<li>Reading <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/">The Rust Programming Language</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/">/r/rust</a> for misc. discovery</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaYhcUwRBNscFNUKTjgPFiA">Conference talks on YouTube</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Please contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/AmaanC">Twitter (@AmaanC)</a> if you have
any suggestions for other fields to consider, or if you want to participate in
an &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; of your own and would like to be experiment-buddies, or if you
want to send me poop-on-fire and need my mailing address.</p>
