      <description>Context I recently finished an undergrad degree at a college I hated (horribly bureaucratic, untrained professors, donkey-work for projects/assignments).
I feel like I have a 4 year debt to make up for - skills I should have learned in my undergrad, but never had the time to. In the coming year or so, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to fix that by experimenting much more, and hopefully picking up skills that I think are important to me.</description>
