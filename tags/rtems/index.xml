      <title>Introduction to my GSoC project: An RTEMS x86-64 port</title>

      <description>RTEMS is an RTOS which can run on tons of architectures and processor families within those architectures.
However, the modern Intel x86-64 / AMD64 is not one of the currently supported architectures.
&amp;lt;infomerical time&amp;gt;
Have you ever wanted to try a new operating system for your project, but all the emulators for your target processor support a limited number of features, and you really don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to test it all on your hardware?</description>

      <description>Here I&amp;rsquo;ll document some of the preperatory tasks I undertook as part of my proposal to RTEMS (AN RTOS THAT&amp;rsquo;S BEEN TO SPACE! SPAAAAAAAAAACE!).
The Hunt To start at the beginning, I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to just say that finding an organization that piques your interest and needs a project that hits just the sweet-spot in &amp;ldquo;I have most of the skills to do this, but I&amp;rsquo;ll still need to learn and grow a lot to bring it to fruition&amp;rdquo; is hard.</description>
