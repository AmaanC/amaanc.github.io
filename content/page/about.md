Hi! I'm Amaan, and this is my ranty little blog. I like to rant and occasionally
string together a coherent sentence about technologies that interest me.

In the past I've been interested in these things to varying degrees:

- Reverse engineering
- x86 assembly
- Binary exploitation
- WebAssembly
- Common Lisp
- Cryptography
- Emacs! (<3)
- Node.js
- Python

I love talking to fellow nerds, so [hit me up if you'd like to talk about
anything!](https://twitter.com/AmaanC)

Oh, one last thing! Check out this [really cool thing I did.](https://g.whatthedude.com/game)
