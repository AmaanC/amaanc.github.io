# Context

I recently finished an undergrad degree at a college I _hated_ (horribly
bureaucratic, untrained professors, donkey-work for projects/assignments).

I feel like I have a 4 year debt to make up for - skills I should have learned
in my undergrad, but never had the time to. In the coming year or so, I'm hoping
to fix that by experimenting much more, and hopefully picking up skills that I
think are important to me. For lack of a better name for what I plan to spend my
free time on in the coming year or so, I'll call it...

# The Experiment

Tentatively, I'm considering 2 weeks of low-key, research time, followed by 2
months of intensive study and practice in the given field. Since I don't plan to
uproot my life and follow a rigid schedule (I'll continue to have a personal
life, work part-time, work on open-source, etc.) I think managing 1 or 2
subjects at a time is likely the most I can handle.

## Candidate skills

- Writing (starting with this very post :))
- Marketing
- Illustration
- Sales
- Game theory (I took one course when I was 14 thinking it was about the theory
  of games, and I went halfway through it - it blew my mind)
- Physics (light, energy, astronomy, quantum mechanics) - likely split it into
  its own respective fields when I get around to it
- Math (topology, category theory, chaos theory)
- Programming language theory
- Compiler theory (optimizations, transformations, safety)
- Embedded systems and electronics
- Cryptography?
- Distributed systems and server-management
- Quantum computing
- Neuroscience, neurobiology, neuroengineering
  ([braaiiiiinsssss!](https://i.imgur.com/ibsNHc6.png))
- Art (generative art, painting, sculpting)
- History (what's humanity accomplished so far?)
- Music

This is an entirely non-committal list, of course. My broad aim in studying
these fields is to maximize my skillset in areas that I think will have the
largest impact on our future. The overarching goals I have as my motivation for
these skills are:

- Programming language theory - imagine how much faster our rate of innovation
  could be if we had languages that made formal verification easier? (NASA
  spends months reviewing code, statically analyzing it - languages like Rust
  may eliminate a whole class of errors that need to be checked for, right?)
- Quantum computing - because it's _quantum freaking computing!_ I imagine
  this will be the radical shift that makes the impractical science fiction
  possible.
- Neuroengineering - if we could help more people "be better" (mood disorders,
  memory problems, paralysis), through whatever means (programming the brain,
  cyborg prosthetics, technology-aids), we could help unleash the potential of
  _so many_ more people.
- Communication - our ideas are worthless if we can't actually communicate them
  and have others help make them reality. Some skills like sales, marketing,
  illustration, I don't really care for myself, but I do believe a basic
  knowledge in these areas is necessary if I'm to succeed in my larger
  goals. I'm okay to pick up enough to understand when I've found a brilliant
  salesperson or illustrator. Besides, I believe anything can be interesting if
  you dive deep enough and actually scratch the surface. There's always
  complexity that can be fascinating.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How I go about acquiring these skills will likely vary from field to field - it
would be nice if I could find people to exchange skills with (i.e. I teach you
something I know, such as programming, systems programming, introductory German,
basic Math, Physics, etc. and you teach me one of the skills above (or really
anything, honestly, I love learning)).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Life _is_ going to get in the way, inevitably, so I'm being noncommittal about
both which topics I pick and when their "deadlines" will be - but I need to keep
in mind that there _will_ be deadlines. I've focused on my little bubble of tech
for some 8 years - I ought to broaden my horizons, so to speak.

# Let the games begin

### Writing

For starters, this blog will be my test-bed to improve my writing. I don't intend
to study writing intensively, except perhaps reading more blogs, "finding my
voice", and perhaps reading Stephen King's On Writing.

I'll try to blog more about knickknacks I find fascinating and end up
researching here and there too.

### Rust

As a build-up towards programming language theory, I'm likely going to have to
study more languages that aim for lofty goals such as memory-safety, data-race
protection, and increased usability _without_ sacrificing performance.

Also, I need to learn me some Rust for my day-job, a convenient coincidence.

I think the activities that'll help me learn it are:

- Reading a lot of varied Rust code (Github
  ([Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) looks interesting), [CodeReview on
  StackExchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rust),
  answering questions on StackOverflow)
- Reading [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/)
- [/r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/) for misc. discovery
- [Conference talks on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaYhcUwRBNscFNUKTjgPFiA)
